# Carta
A simple PHP library for logging exceptions &amp; errors easily and later viewing them in a simple page. Works only with MySQL databases.

View page uses Foundation CSS.

**Written very quickly and carelessly in vanilla PHP, just for a very small project. You really shouldn't use this in a project, unless it's for a very small project and you don't care.**
